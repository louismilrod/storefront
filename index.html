            <h2>1993-08-12</h2>
            <p>Syncopated grooving that departs the "norm" and features a fun, intense breakdown, with truly remarkable full-band exploration, a la "David Bowie." The playing almost gets pushed back to "Reba" territory before collapsing totally into improvisational "Bomb-Facotry-esque" wonkiness.</p>

            <h2>1995-12-31</h2>
            <p>NYE's huge "Reba" finds the band recovering from a botched composed section to create a classic. Measured and magisterial, Trey leads the band as they blaze from one side of harmony to the other, the musicians collectively working their way through starts and stops - and all points inbetween - to build a bliss-tinged climax. Wonderful.</p>

            <h2>2000-07-06</h2>
            <p>Huge show-opener featuring focused, pretty play, and the interesting sort of innovation associated with 2000 jamming. In lieu of pursuing a "peak," the band plays patiently, deft musicianship on full display, Trey in particular working through a number of ideas and really incredible effects, culminating in great "strumming" which, later, he revisits note for note.</p>

            <h2>2003-08-02</h2>
            <p>An outstanding version for any era, the IT "Reba" towers above its peers from '03 - '04. Pulling away from typical "Reba" jamming at 8:45, the play breaks into warm-hearted major mode at 11:10 and continues for several minutes, before cleanly working its way back home to a spirited finale.</p>

            <h2>2014-07-04</h2>
            <p>Precise, delicate, and moving, very pretty play informs subdued jamming, featuring notable full-band interaction. Trey deftly shapes his tone, and the version becomes somewhat hypnotic and enchanting, with the musicians responding one to another before driving the jam to an expansive, emphatic peak.</p>

            <h2>2016-06-29</h2>
            <p>No mere novelty, the band's incredibly slow take on the composed section (better heard than described) seems to dissolve as muscle memory takes over, the torpid pace impossible to sustain. This inspires several minutes of particularly soulful and melodic jamming, which, in fun Phish fashion, dissolves into an inane whistling section.</p>
